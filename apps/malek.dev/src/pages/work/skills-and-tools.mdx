I started my hands-on career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2024} years ago**. I've tried various programming languages and tech stacks, both Back-End and Front-End.

I specialize in building full-stack applications with modern technologies, working with **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and more. I've developed production-ready applications with end-to-end functionality, from responsive UIs to scalable backend systems.

## Full-Stack Developer

I've built expertise across the full development stack, with hands-on experience in modern frameworks, databases, and deployment solutions.

---

## Front-End Development

Building responsive, performant, and user-friendly interfaces is my passion. I work with modern frameworks and tools to create seamless user experiences.

### React

React.js is my go-to front-end library due to its ease of implementation, flexible structure, and seamless UI development. It leverages JSX as a declarative markup syntax, making component-based development more intuitive and efficient.

### Next.js

Next.js takes React to the next level with server-side rendering, static site generation, and built-in routing. I've used it to build production-grade applications with optimized performance and SEO.

### TypeScript

Stronger types, fewer bugs—that's why I rely on TypeScript. I use it to write cleaner, more maintainable code with excellent developer experience and autocomplete support.

### Tailwind CSS

Utility-first styling is my thing, and Tailwind CSS makes it effortless. I use it to create sleek, responsive designs with minimal effort and maximum flexibility!

### Angular

Angular is a powerful framework I've added to my skillset for building enterprise-level applications with strong typing, dependency injection, and comprehensive tooling.

### Bootstrap

Rapid prototyping? Bootstrap has my back. I use it to craft clean and responsive layouts in no time, especially for quick MVPs and prototypes.

### Framer Motion

For smooth animations and interactive UIs, Framer Motion is my choice. It integrates seamlessly with React to create delightful user experiences.

## Back-End Development

Building scalable, secure, and efficient server-side applications is crucial. I work with modern backend technologies to create robust APIs and data management systems.

### Node.js

Building scalable back-end services? Node.js makes it a breeze. I've been working with it extensively, and its speed and efficiency never fail to impress!

### Express.js

Minimal yet powerful—Express.js helps me structure APIs like a pro. I use it to create seamless back-end solutions with RESTful architecture.

### PostgreSQL

When data integrity and relational structure matter, PostgreSQL is my go-to. I've built complex database schemas with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints for production applications.

### Prisma

Prisma ORM revolutionizes database work with type-safe queries and migrations. I use it for seamless TypeScript integration, making database operations intuitive and error-free.

### MongoDB

For flexible, document-based storage, MongoDB is my choice. I leverage it for dynamic applications where schema flexibility is essential.

### Stripe

Implementing secure payment systems is critical. I've integrated Stripe for handling payments, subscriptions, and checkout flows in production applications.

### Firebase

Real-time database, authentication, and hosting in one? Firebase keeps things simple for rapid development and prototyping!

### JWT & Authentication

Security is paramount. I implement JWT-based authentication and authorization systems to protect user data and manage sessions securely.

---

## Development Tools & Workflow

Efficient development requires the right tools. Here's what powers my daily workflow.

### Git & GitHub

Version control is essential. Git & GitHub keep my projects organized, enable collaboration, and maintain code history effectively.

### VS Code

My primary code editor with extensive extensions for productivity, debugging, and seamless development experience.

### Claude AI

AI-powered coding assistant that helps with problem-solving, code review, and learning new technologies faster.

### Cursor

AI-native code editor that enhances productivity with intelligent code suggestions and refactoring.

### IntelliJ IDEA

For Java and enterprise applications, IntelliJ IDEA provides powerful refactoring and debugging capabilities.

### Postman

API testing and documentation made easy. Essential for backend development and testing endpoints.
