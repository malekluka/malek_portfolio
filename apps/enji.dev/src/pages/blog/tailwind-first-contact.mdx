## Introduction

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that I recently explored and implemented in several projects. Initially, it felt a bit strange to use so many classes in the HTML, but the more I worked with it, the more I appreciated its flexibility and speed. This post summarizes all the key features, tools, and best practices I’ve learned about Tailwind CSS.

## Utility-First Approach

The core philosophy of Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first** approach, which means that instead of writing custom CSS for every component, you use utility classes to style your elements. This can seem overwhelming at first but is a huge time-saver once you get the hang of it.

Example:

```html
<div class="rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">
  Tailwind makes styling fast and intuitive.
</div>
```
